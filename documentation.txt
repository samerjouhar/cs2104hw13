In order to run our program the user must first execute it then it will prompt to enter a password.
The program will then attempt to crack the password after it is hashed using SHA256 and SHA512 
with the dictionary attack, keeping track of the time it takes for each. This will be displayed 
to the user. The results are presented in a bar graph once the user quits the program by typing q in
the input field. This bar graph shows all the the passwords difficulty vs. the number of guesses of
the passwords that the user entered during the session. The x-axis is the passwords difficulty and 
the y-axis being the number of guesses. Additionally, when the user exits the program the total time 
of thier session will be displayed.
